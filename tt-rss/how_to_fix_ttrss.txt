I had this problem updating my multiuser installation from 1.3.3 to 1.4.3 just now. My access_level was 5 and it needed to be 10.

Documenting specifically what I did to help anybody in the future who isn't mysql savvy:
mysql -u <sqluser> -p <dbname>
Password: <sqlpasswd>
update ttrss_users set access_level=10 where login = '<ttuser>';
exit

Where <sqluser> and <sqlpasswd> and <dbname> are specified as DB_USER and DB_PASS and DB_NAME in config.php and <ttuser> is the account name used to log into tt-rss.
